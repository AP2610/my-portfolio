          <p>
            I'm a frontend engineer with 5 years of experience. I create beautiful, interactive and accessible applications that
            prioritise UX. While trained as a full-stack developer, I leaned into frontend because of its direct user impact. With
            a user-centric mindset, I'm always looking for ways to improve the experience.
          </p>

          <p>
            I specialise in React, Next.js, Javascript, Typescript, TailwindCSS, and Sanity CMS With more than 4 years of React
            experience. I also have some experience with Nuxt.js and Vue. My fundamentals are strong, having worked on many
            vanilla JavaScript projects in the past. My experience with these technologies spans numerous industries like
            e-commerce, telecom, logistics, media, and the public sector. From large-scale e-commerce and telecom to projects like
            the Corona Dashboard which served the entirety of the Netherlands, I'm comfortable working on all sizes of projects.
          </p>

          <p>
            With an education and background in hospitality, I am detail-oriented and have strong interpersonal skills. Having
            lived in Australia, India, Kenya, Switzerland, and the Netherlands, I understand cultural dynamics well and find
            myself fitting into diverse teams easily. Beyond coding, my strengths lie in coaching juniors, technical analysis,
            strategic planning, giving presentations, and communication.

I've done this a few times already and hope to do more in the future. I've been told that I'm quite good at creating and giving presentations, often geeking out on desiging slides. Apart from that, I consider myself adept in technical analysis and strategic planning for new and existing projects.`,

          for refactoringâ€”a clean, well-structured codebase is paramount to long-term productivity and maintainability. However, I
          also understand the need for balance between code quality and efficient delivery. Like my mother taught me, "a clean

          into my development workflow to enhance productivity when needed. While I still enjoy doing things manually for the sake of learning and staying sharp, when I need speed, AI is the way to go. In any case, not a single line of AI generated code gets through without thorough scrutiny and review. Beyond work, I use AI extensively in my personal life, whether it's for DIY projects or recipe
          development, it helps me get to where I am trying to go faster.`,

          codebase improves both productivity and collaboration. Having worked on a wide variety of codebases, I've seen the good, bad, and ugly. While I'm comfortable working in less than optimal set ups, I've seen first-hand the productivity gains of a clean, well-structured codebase. Additionally, working in teams with a varying range of experience, I've learnt the importance
          of keeping code understandable by all levels.`,
