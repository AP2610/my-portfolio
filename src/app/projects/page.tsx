              These are some of the most impactful projects I've worked onâ€”both in my growth as a developer and in their impact on
              users. These aren't all the projects I've contributed to throughout my career, but the most substantial ones.

              Earlier in my career, I worked on fully custom WordPress implementations, handling both frontend and backend
              development. These projects leveraged the then-new Gutenberg editor, which heavily utilises React. This was my first
              professional exposure to React and marked the beginning of my journey into modern frontend development.
